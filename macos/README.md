## üß© Key Differences from Linux Setup

1. **Package Management**
   - Uses Homebrew instead of apt/pacman
   - Supports both CLI tools and GUI applications via Homebrew Casks

2. **Path Handling**
   - Handles different paths for Intel and Apple Silicon Macs
   - Provides seamless support for both architectures

3. **System Configuration**
   - Uses `defaults` command to configure macOS preferences
   - Sets up developer-friendly keyboard shortcuts and UI settings

4. **Terminal Setup**
   - Configures iTerm2 as the preferred terminal emulator
   - Provides custom profile with key bindings and appearance settings

5. **CLI Utilities**
   - Adds macOS-specific shell functions in `sh/macos.sh`
   - Provides convenient wrappers for macOS-specific operations

6. **Window Management**
   - Yabai tiling window manager for Linux-like window management
   - Skhd hotkey daemon for keyboard shortcuts
